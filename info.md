# Soniox

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech for Home Assistant by **Francesco Masaia**,
powered by [Soniox](https://soniox.com) — 60+ languages, low-latency streaming.

## Highlights

- Real-time STT (`stt-rt-v5`) — WebSocket streaming with final tokens and a home-assistant context that includes your rooms and devices.
- Async STT (`stt-async-v5`) — file upload + poll for higher-accuracy transcripts.
- TTS (`tts-rt-v2`) with 28 voices, every voice speaks every language.
- Per-call voice and audio-format overrides.
- No external Python dependencies — built on Home Assistant's bundled `aiohttp`.

1. Install via HACS, restart Home Assistant.
2. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Soniox**.
3. Paste an API key from [console.soniox.com](https://console.soniox.com)
